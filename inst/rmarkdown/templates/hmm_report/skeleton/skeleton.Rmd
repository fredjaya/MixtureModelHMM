The `run_hmm()` object is passed over to the template to create plots and tables using save_report().
If you want to run thr R code chunks below you would have to rename `hmm_result` with your `run_hmm()` output object.

## Plotting the raw data
```{r}
hmm_result$initial_scatter_plot
```

## Summary
```{r}
summary(hmm_result)
```

### Alignment Plot

hmm_result$alignment_plot
```
### Transition table
